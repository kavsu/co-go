									<h3 class="title_color">Literature Survey</h3>
									<p> There are around 2.2 billion gamers around the world.  
										Out of the assessed 7.6 billion individuals living on earth, 
										as of July 2018, that implies nearly 33% of individuals on 
										this planet are gamers. Out of those 2.2 billion gamers, 
										1.2 billion of the players play PC games.
									</p>
									<p>
										The gaming industry is the only one merchant that endeavors on via ducting the hole 
										between technology and humans to crop up with a modernistic experience.
										The gaming industry has tried from time to time to prove and provide 
										amusement, also aiding to polish motor  skills, developing tactical opinion, 
										and thus contributing to the comprehensive wellbeing of a player. As for 
										the concern of gamers’ physical movement, the gaming world has grabbed it 
										firmly with games that make a player use his motor skills in order to succeed 
										at the respective level. For the emotional gamut, the gaming world has made some 
										evolution with emotion-aware gaming which recognizes and interprets the 
										player’s emotion in real-time.
									</p>
									<p>	
										Emotion recognition and viable contribution are nowadays well prestigious traits of intelligent gaming systems. Facial expression detection results 
										in identifying and predicting the basic emotions of an individualsuch as anger, panic, sorrow,
										happiness, disgust, surprise and shock and predicting the emotional range of a particular player 
										is going through as a percentage. This could be achievable by recording a video sequence of a 
										player  playing  a game and analyzing its frames based on a pre-collected dataset. 
										Meanwhile variables like age, gender and skills are also identified to provide a unique user 
										experience.
									</p>
									<p>	
										Emotion recognition can not only be done through facial expression but also the 
										heartbeat. The heart rate can change according to the change of users’ emotions. Analyzing th
										is resultin identifying and predicting the basic emotions of an individual like anger, panic, 
										sorrow, happiness, disgust, surprise and shock and predicting the emotional range of a particular 
										player is going through as a percentage.The most important for our gameis happy, angry and neutral.
									</p>	
									<p>
										To provide a unique experience to the user, the user’s abilities and expertise(skill level)as a 
										gamer should be identified. Whether the player is a pro level gamer, an intermediate or a beginner. 
										Obtain data from the haptic feedback of users and analyzing them to identify the players 
										experience level would be more efficient.. Here the haptic feedback will be obtained through the 
										keyboard key-logger. The key-logger will change from one player to another, 
										in each player a variance in key pressing time and pattern could be observed.
									</p>
									<p>
										When it comes to identifying emotions, the easiest way to capture the player’s facial expressions 
										is capturing through a video sequence taken using the web camera. Most gamers play games through a 
										laptop which has an inbuilt web camera or a personal computer with an external web camera. Even 
										though it is an effective method to capture facial expressions most of the web cameras have low quality 
										and low resolutions. Sometimes the players also tend to play games in low lighting which also affects 
										the image quality. So that, before analyzing and identifying the emotions displayed by the player, the 
										image frames should be enhanced using image processing enhancement techniques. 
									</p>
									<p>	
										When solely depending on either emotion predicted from the facial expression or heart rate it might not give us a hundred percent 
										accurate result. Therefore, we have to analyze the results taken from both heartbeat and facial expression 
										to obtain an accurate result. For example: Even though the players facial expression looks angry he or she 
										might  not  be feeling angry. We are doing this to identify how interactive the user is with the game. If 
										the user is in angry mood or stressed, it is automatically checked if the player is stuck at alevel because 
										it is too hard, So the game level  will be made easy so the user can  move forward and their stress level or 
										anger will be reduced. Or if the user is bored because the game is too easy, where in this situation the game 
										will be made hard and challenging. This is done to keep the user engaged with the game and also to improve user 
										attraction. When adjusting the hardness level of the game, the emotions from facial expression and heartbeat 
										along with the haptic feedback from keyboard, age and gender are used to identify what type of user he or she is, 
										what their skills are.

									<h3 class="title_color">Research Gap</h3>
									<p> When it comes to the past research studies, the research team could 
										find several systems which are implemented for Adaptable Game.  
										But there are a lot of systems that have been implemented to 
										predict emotions using either facial expression or heartbeat which gives 
										an output separately but does not give a percentage of the particular 
										emotion. So,in our research we are developing a game that adapts and adjusts 
										according to the emotional level by analyzing both emotional levels given from 
										heartbeat and facial expression to make an accurate decision.So, using that 
										final decision, the hardness of the game level will be changed based on the 
										current situation of the player. And, the characteristics of the game character 
										and abilities will be also adjusted accordingly at Real-time. Both these features 
										are also affected by age, gender, face shapeand haptic feedback of the player. 
										At this moment we couldn’t find a game that adapts and adjusts automatically by 
										analyzing all the inputs at Real-time. But there are applications that can identify 
										face shape and transfer it to the character so the characters can mimic our actions. 
										And there are games that can capture your face and apply it to the character of the 
										game, but it is not Real-time and it also takes a lot time.
									</p>
									<p> There are numerous applications that recognize emotions using facial expressions. But 
										there are no applications that give emotion as a percentagewhich is used for adjusting the game level4.
									</p>
									<p> Haptic feedback is implemented by researches to check the player’s skills but we couldn’t find a game 
										that has used haptic feedback to analyses the type of player and his or skills and then use that 
										information to change the hardness level or adjust the character.

									<h3 class="title_color"  id="rp">Research Problem</h3>
									<p> When talking about entertainment, what comes into our mind aregames. Gamescan be categorized in to two.
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Physical games
											<ul>
												<li>Indoor games/sports</li>
												<li>Outdoor games/ sports</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Online games
											<ul>
												<li>Mobile games</li>
												<li>Personal computer games</li>
											</ul>
									</li>
									</ol>
									<p> With the busy &tight schedules people refuseto engage in physicalgames most of the instancesdue to reasons 
										such as.
									</p>
										<ul>
											<li>They have less time(They can pause an online gameand continue later on, but that cannot be done with most of the offline/physical games)</li>
											<li>It is hard to gather people (due to busyness) for outdoor games.</li>
											<li>Fear of injuries.</li>
											<li>Less physical stamina.</li>
										</ul>
									<p> There we understood that online games could help people to overcome all these problems associated. The following 
										figure shows how the online gaming industry grew up over the past few years. But the research team also noticed 
										that people refuse to play online games due to the level of complexity of some of the levels. Ultimate goal should 
										be to release the stress and boredom not to increase it. 
									</p>
									<p> Therefore, as a Solution a game is being designed that changes the level of hardness or the complexity of the particular 
										level  according  to  the  players’  mood   or   emotionsautomatically. The next level will be auto designed/adjusted 
										based on the previous level player record using an artificial intelligence algorithm.In order to achieve this, heartbeat, 
										facial expressions willbe captured and analyzed toobtain the accurate emotion level of the player using machine learning. 
										This emotion level is taken along with the age gender and haptic feedback to adjust the hardness level of the particular 
										level.

									<h3 class="title_color" id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
									<p> To predict emotions, age,face shape and gender,we need to obtain the facial expression of the 
										user through real-time video. Facial Expressions will be extracted from the frames of the real-time 
										video. A perfect approach to obtain the emotionalstate we need to use Image Processing and Machine 
										LearningAlgorithms.
									</p>
									<p> The best approach to identifying emotions, age, face shape,and gender are using the OpenCV library. 
										In neural networks, Convolutional neural network (ConvNetsor CNNs) is one of the main categories to 
										do images recognition, images classifications. Objects detections, recognition faces etc., are some 
										of the areas where CNNs are widely used. The identification is done by analyzing the frames of a live 
										video that takes live input while the user is playing a game using the web camera.
